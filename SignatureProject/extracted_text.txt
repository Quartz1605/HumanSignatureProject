used to track progress. 
Progress is saved automatically, so do
not refresh the page unnecessarily

before unlocking the next. 
If your team is on Level 5_1, you cannot

Be mindful—wrong attempts might have
penalties.
Do not repeatedly press the submit
button


4. Time Limit & Fair Play
External help is allowed—this includes
using AI tools, online forums, or
external databases.

teams is NOT allowed and this may lead
to disqualification.
Hints will be released every 7 minutes.

report it immediately to the organizers.
